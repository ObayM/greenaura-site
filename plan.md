that's just a file, i love to use while plannig and brainstorming stuff
this would be removed in the final commit - it's just here for myself if you are reading this, don't take it seriously pls

okay first of all, i need to choose the fonts and setup the layout for the website

this includes 
- navbar 
- footer
- fonts

i think i made the hero section and the navbar and they are pretty done well

next is the about-us section and the carousel for the partners and i just finished it, i think it's pretty cool
next is gonna be the about section itself, where what is greenaura and these things goes

the about us section is good but it's really really normal and i think it's somehow bad i don't know but let's see how to make sure it look unique so i think i'll be like writing text without using any images or like some bullet points that moves in and an image, that would be cool too


next is the activiteis/programs section, i think i did it in a pretty well way, so i gonna leave it as it's
